## Open Policy Agent / Rego Cheat Sheet

> This post assumes you have a basic idea of what Open Policy Agent (OPA) is and what role Rego plays - please refer to the [official documentation](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/).

Now that we have the formalities out of the way, let's dive straight in!

In this post we will talk about the following features of Rego:
* assertions
* comprehensions

## Assertions

Imagine we have the following sample data:

```javascript
sites := [
    {"name": "prod"},
    {"name": "smoke1"},
    {"name": "dev"}
]
```

### Here are a few assertions you might want to execute on the above data

1. Verify if there are any _sites_ whose name equals `prod`:
```javascript
r{sites[_].name == "prod" } 
```
One way to read this is:
* within _sites_ there **exists** (at least) one document/object whose _name_ equals _prod_ (the above expression evaluates to `true`).

2. Get the names of all sites as an array:
```javascript
q[name] { name := sites[_].name}
```
In this case, the result of `q` is `["prod", "smoke1", "dev"]`

2.1 Verify if the array of sites defined in example 2 (above) contains a particular item:
```javascript
p{ q["prod"] }
```
As you might have guessed, `p` evaluates to `true`.

## Comprehensions

[Comprehensions](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/#comprehensions) in rego aren't the easiest to understand at first, but once they `click` in your head, you will notice an immediate improvement on the quality of your life, if you, like myself, use Rego at work.

Here is an example of a comprehension - do not worry too much about understanding it at first - we will simply use it as an example to demonstrate the structure that most comprehensions follow in Rego:
```javascript
westSites := [site | sites[i].region == "west"; site := sites[i]]
```

In order to create a comprehension, you need to follow 3 distict steps (at least I do):
1.  first you need to decide on, and declare your `term` or `variable` that will hold your data - this would be the section in bold below:

westSites := **[site** | sites[i].region == "west"; site := sites[i]]

2. then you need to write the body/logic of the comprehension:

westSites := [site | **sites[i].region == "west"**; site := sites[i]]

3. and finally, you need to assign the result of the previous step to the variable we declared in step 1:

westSites := [site | sites[i].region == "west"; **site := sites[i]**]

Let's assume we have the following sample data:
```javascript
sites := [
    {
        "region": "east",
        "name": "prod",
        "servers": [
            {
                "name": "web-0",
                "hostname": "hydrogen"
            },
            {
                "name": "web-1",
                "hostname": "helium"
            },
            {
                "name": "db-0",
                "hostname": "lithium"
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "region": "west",
        "name": "smoke",
        "servers": [
            {
                "name": "web-1000",
                "hostname": "beryllium"
            },
            {
                "name": "web-1001",
                "hostname": "boron"
            },
            {
                "name": "db-1000",
                "hostname": "carbon"
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "region": "west",
        "name": "dev",
        "servers": [
            {
                "name": "web-dev",
                "hostname": "nitrogen"
            },
            {
                "name": "db-dev",
                "hostname": "oxygen"
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

If we were to execute the comprehension we wrote above:
```javascript
westSites := [site | sites[i].region == "west"; site := sites[i]]
```

we would get the following result:
```javascript
[
 {
        "region": "west",
        "name": "smoke",
        "servers": [
            {
                "name": "web-1000",
                "hostname": "beryllium"
            },
            {
                "name": "web-1001",
                "hostname": "boron"
            },
            {
                "name": "db-1000",
                "hostname": "carbon"
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "region": "west",
        "name": "dev",
        "servers": [
            {
                "name": "web-dev",
                "hostname": "nitrogen"
            },
            {
                "name": "db-dev",
                "hostname": "oxygen"
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

To sum up, the above comprehension is asking for all `site` objects that reside in the `west` region.
