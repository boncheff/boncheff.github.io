## Pagination in Mongo

Pagination in Mongo can be achieved with two approaches:
- using [`cursor.skip`](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/cursor.skip/) and [`cursor.limit`](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/cursor.limit/)
- using [`ObjectId`](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/bson-types/#objectid) and [`cursor.limit`](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/cursor.limit/)

## Using `cursor.skip` and `cursor.limit`

The `skip-limit` process is as follows:
- you query Mongo for the data you need using [`db.collection.find()`](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.collection.find/#db.collection.find) which returns you a cursor to those documents
- you apply `skip`, which controls where MongoDB begins returning results 
- you apply `limit`, which specifies the maximum number of documents the cursor will return

### Imagine you have a `transactions` collection that contains 500 entries and you would like to see a list of objects in blocks of 100

To return the first 100 transactions matching the filter criteria you can run:
```json
db.transactions.find(<filter-criteria>).limit(100) 
```

If you want to return another 100 transactions, after the first block of 100, you can run:
```json
db.transactions.find(<filter-criteria>).skip(100).limit(100)
```

Seems quite straightforward! However, the biggest drawback of this approach is that it requires the server to scan from **the beginning of the input results set** before beginning to return results. As the offset increases, `skip()` will become slower.
